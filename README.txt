I.  Introduction

The "Restricted Front Desk" arose out of a request from a client of mine who 
was using Soft Ventures' Appointment Booking Pro 2 add-on to manage client
bookings on their website.

They wanted something very close to the "Front Desk" functionality, but 
in a form that more tightly focused the displayed data on the logged in 
user.

Additionally, they wanted to create "global" events to show when special 
occasions for the business were happening that would be visible to any user.

II.  Functionality

This extension provides a read-only calendar that will behave as follows:

1)  When no user is logged in to Joomla, only "global" events will be displayed

2)  When a registered user logs in, it will show global events, plus appointment summaries for that user.

III.  Usage Notes

1)  Global Events
	- One Appointment Category can be specified as "global" in the configuration screen.
	- Global Events use the "Admin Comments" to acquire a description of the event.

IV.  Integration

This is not a "plug-and-play" integration yet.  There are parts of this 
application which require changes to the original source.  

Where there are overlaps, I have tried to clearly denote the changes which are 
related specifically to this application. 

It is highly recommended that integration be done very carefully.  There are
only about a dozen or so files in total for the extension, so identifying the
overlap points should be fairly easy.
